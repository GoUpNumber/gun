`gun` is a CLI Bitcoin wallet for plebs, degenerates and revolutionaries.
Its distinguishing feature is the ability to do [peer-to-peer betting](/docs/bet.md).

**âš  WARNING EXPERIMENTAL**

The wallet is alpha quality.
It is buggy and is missing features.
The underlying wallet functionality is built with the awesome [Bitcoin Dev Kit](bitcoindevkit.org) but the betting functionality is freshly engineered.
Only put into it what you are willing to lose.
Thanks for testing this for me and thank you in advance for any coins you sacrafice along the way.

## Install

For now, you must build the binary yourself.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/LLFourn/gun
cd gun
cargo install --path .
# or the edgy version if you are on nightly
cargo -Z avoid-dev-deps install --features=nightly --path .
# Make sure ~/.cargo/bin is in your $PATH
```


## Configuration

The configuration file is in `~/.gun/config.json`.

By default `gun init` sets [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) as the backend.
You could choose blockstream's esplora server by setting `blockchain` to:

``` sh
{
  "type": "esplora",
  "base_url": "https://blockstream.info/api",
  "concurrency": 4,
  "stop_gap": 10
}
```

You could also run your own [esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora) server.

## Basic Wallet

The cli is decently documented with `--help` but here's a few things to get you started:

### Initialize wallet

``` sh
gun init bitcoin # or regtest or testnet
```

By default your wallet config and db will be stored in `~/.gun` and your seed words will be in `~/.gun/seed.txt`.
Note that `gun` uses standard [BIP84] derivation

**save your seedwords somewhere else (don't delete them though)**

### Get an address

``` sh
gun address new
```

### Check balance

Check your wallet's balance:

``` sh
gun balance
```

Check your wallet's balance but sync before:

``` sh
gun -s balance
```

Before any command you can put `-s` before it to tell the wallet it should sync with the blockchain before continuing.

### Send coins

``` sh
gun send 0.1BTC <address>
```

Send all coins in your wallet

``` sh
gun send all <address>
```
